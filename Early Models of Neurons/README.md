# Lab 1
This lab implements the following models of a neuron:
* McCulloch-Pitts Model
* Rosenblatt's Perceptron Model
* Widrow's ADALINE Model

## Tasks:
* Demonstrate the realization of NAND gate, NOR gate, and XOR gate using McCullochPitts 
(MP) and Rosenblatt’s Perceptron model.
* Demonstrate the realization of y = 1 + 2x1 + 2x2 using Widrow’s Adaline model.
